The standard 'Heatsink for 2 CPU Configuration' is designed to dissipate heat for processors with a TDP of up to 200W per CPU. When paired with a 300W processor, this heatsink cannot effectively remove the excess heat, leading to overheating. Overheating can trigger thermal throttling—where the processor reduces its speed to lower its temperature—resulting in significant performance drops. In severe cases, prolonged overheating could damage the CPU or other components. This mismatch occurs because high-performance processors like the Platinum 8452Y, with 36 cores and a high turbo frequency, demand advanced cooling solutions to operate reliably, especially in dual-CPU setups where heat dissipation needs are doubled.",

Since direct-attached NVMe drives lack a central controller, RAID 0 cannot be configured, potentially leading to system instability or data loss if attempted. This incompatibility arises because direct-attached NVMe drives prioritize low latency and high performance over traditional RAID functionality.",

As a result, the memory will be downclocked to 4400MT/s, eliminating the performance advantage of the faster memory.
